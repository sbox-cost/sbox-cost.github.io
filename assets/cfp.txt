## About the workshop
 
Benchmarking plays a critical role in the design and development of optimization algorithms. The way in which benchmark suites are set up thus influences the set of algorithms recommended to practitioners and biases the goals of algorithm designers. The focus of this workshop is on benchmarking algorithms on problems with box constraints (i.e. upper and lower limits on the input variables defining the domain of the search space). In practical applications, evaluating points outside of the domain is often impossible, or not sensible, and as such, should be avoided. However, in benchmarking as practiced today, problems are well-defined even outside of the stated parameter ranges, which translates to the algorithms being able to safely ignore these ranges and operate on infeasible solutions.

Setting up box constraints represents the simplest type of constraints and gives rise to the so-called box-constrained problems. In this workshop, we will discuss in more detail how the presence of box-constraints impacts the performance of optimization algorithms and provide participants with a new variant of the BBOB suite called SBOX-COST for continuous, single-objective, noiseless optimization. 

Two types of submissions will be accepted for this workshop: 

1. Short papers (up to 4 pages) reporting results of new or existing algorithms on the provided BBOB SBOX-COST suite of (box-constrained) test functions. Please refer to the following link for the data and instructions on how to use it LINK TO EXAMPLE DATA

2. Longer papers (up to 8 pages) discussing aspects related to the presence of box-constraints. 

Topics of interest (but not limited to) include:
 • New insights of existing algorithms when applied to box-constrained problems
 • Performance analysis and visualization of algorithms on the provided BBOB SBOX-COST suite of test functions
 • Algorithm design for box-constrained problems 
 • Metrics for benchmarking algorithm performance on and complexity of box-constrained problems
 • Other aspects of box-constrained benchmarking optimization algorithms
